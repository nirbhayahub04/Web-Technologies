    <P> <H3><Em>Art, also called (to distinguish it from other art forms) visual art, a visual object or 
        experience consciously created through an expression of skill or imagination. The term art 
        encompasses diverse media such as painting, sculpture, printmaking, drawing, decorative arts, 
        photography, and installation.</Em></H3></P><br>
    <p><H3>The various visual arts exist within a continuum that ranges from purely aesthetic purposes at one 
        end to purely utilitarian purposes at the other. Such a polarity of purpose is reflected in the 
        commonly used terms artist and artisan, the latter understood as one who gives considerable attention 
        to the utilitarian. This should by no means be taken as a rigid scheme, however. Even within one form 
        of art, motives may vary widely; thus a potter or a weaver may create a highly functional work that is 
        at the same time beautiful—a salad bowl, for example, or a blanket—or may create works that have no 
        purpose beyond being admired. In cultures such as those of Africa and Oceania, a definition of art that
         encompasses this continuum has existed for centuries. In the West, however, by the mid-18th century 
         the development of academies for painting and sculpture established a sense that these media were 
         “art” and therefore separate from more utilitarian media. This separation of art forms continued 
         among art institutions until the late 20th century, when such rigid distinctions began to be 
         questioned.

          <h1> Giorgio de Chirico </h1>
          <P> <h3>Giorgio de Chirico, (born July 10, 1888, Vólos, Greece—died 
            Nov. 19, 1978, Rome, Italy), Italian painter who, with 
            Carlo Carrà and Giorgio Morandi, founded the style of 
            Metaphysical painting.

            The Soothsayer's Recompense, oil on canvas by Giorgio de Chirico, 1913; in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
            After studying art in Athens and Florence, de Chirico moved to Germany in 
            1906 and entered the Munich Academy of Fine Arts. His early style was influenced by Arnold 
            Böcklin’s and Max Klinger’s paintings, which juxtapose the fantastic with the commonplace. 
            By 1910 de Chirico was living in Florence, where he began painting a unique series of landscapes 
            that included The Enigma of an Autumn Afternoon (1910), in which the long, sinister, and illogical
             shadows cast by unseen objects onto empty city spaces contrast starkly with bright, clear light
              that is rendered in brooding green tonalities. Moving to Paris in 1911, de Chirico gained the
               admiration of Pablo Picasso and Guillaume Apollinaire with his ambiguously ominous scenes of 
               deserted piazzas. In these works, such as The Soothsayer’s Recompense (1913) and The Mystery
                and Melancholy of a Street (1914), classical statues, dark arcades, and small, isolated
                 figures are overpowered by their own shadows and by severe, oppressive architecture.</h3></P><br>

                    ways of creating striking compositions. In fact, his signature triangular composition is
                    still used today and is widely considered one of the most visually pleasing painting 
                    layouts. He was also an early advocate of studying anatomical models to perfect his art, 
                    something that was illegal at the time.</h3></p>
